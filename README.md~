## This repository will help us work as a distributed team without stepping on each other's toes.

If you don't know how to use Git, you might want to google a quick tutorial. I recommend you use the Github client http://mac.github.com/ or http://windows.github.com/.

Also, I propose that we typeset the report using [Lyx](http://www.lyx.org/). It's a GUI for LaTex, and it works really well on any platform.
