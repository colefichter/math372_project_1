Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The problem of 
\emph on
effectively
\emph default
 allocating finite resources has been known for centuries.
 Certainly, as long as there have been functional economies (even systems
 as simple as barter networks) producers have been pressured to utilize
 labour, capital, and raw materials in the most efficient manner possible.
 More generally, there exist a class of problems known as Assignment Problems.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the most general case, the Assignment Problem boils down to

.
 This could mean assigning workers of various skill levels to machines in
 a factory, scheduling specific types of products to be produced on assembly
 lines of varying capacity, reducing change-over and re-tooling costs during
 production, or many other problems.
 In this paper, we examine the problem of assigning a varied workload of
 tasks to a group of employees of varying skill levels in such a way that
 we minimize the elapsed time, commonly referred to as the 
\noun on
makespan

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our problem is important because it directly affects the throughput and,
 therefore, the profitability of the office we study.
 By finding an optimal assignment strategy that minimizes the amount of
 time it takes to complete a task, we can be sure that the office operates
 in an efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable manner over the long term.

\begin_layout Subsection
Historical Context
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While people have encountered Assignment Problems for at least several centuries
, they lacked the tools to effectively tackle them, especially in the general
 sense, until fairly recently.
 Indeed, neither the Renaissance nor the Industrial Revolution produced
 the necessary confluence of applied and theoretical mathematics and advanced
 computational technology required to enable business owners to solve these
 types of problems unassisted.

The Employee Scheduling Problem
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, we examine an insurance office that handles two types of
 work: creating new policies, and preparing claims.
 The office has three employees of varying skill levels, who each take different
 lengths of time (on average) to complete a given task.
 Here we see the average time (in minutes) required for each employee to
 complete each task type.

The insurance company has compiled the timings above by empirical measurement.
 We assume that the company has a healthy business and, therefore, that
 there is a steady stream of New Policy and Claim tasks that require processing
 by the office employees.
 Under these circumstances, the insurance company is interested in assigning
 some fraction of the incoming tasks to each employee so as to minimize
 the

, or the elapsed time required to finish all of the tasks.

To answer the question

how should the insurance company assign tasks to its employees to minimize

 We consider 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}$

 and

The first two constraints ensure that all of our tasks get assigned.
 For obvious reasons, it would not be an optimal schedule to only assign
 a portion of, say, the New Policy tasks, since by definition the unassigned
 portion would not be completed.
 The final three constraints ensure that when we allocate tasks to each
 employee, each allocation falls below the same bounding value for elapsed
 time.
 By constraining the model in this manner, we ensure that no employee exceeds
 the elapsed time of his peers or the optimal elapsed time,

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Observations of the Basic Solution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, note that our solution is only useful in the long-term.
 It wouldn't make sense to assign 0.6% of a single task to one employee.
 In addition to being impractical, the cost of context-switching as the
 employees handed off the partially completed task would outweigh any potential
 time savings.
 Rather, our scheduling solution would be better applied to a large list
 of tasks.
 For example, if the office had a long backlog of work (say, several hundred
 tasks) or if the insurance company is busy (and healthy), receiving a constant
 and fairly steady stream of work every day for the foreseeable future.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is interesting to note that, while no 
\emph on
individual
\emph default
 employee is able to finish any single task in less than ten minutes, our
 optimal scheduling strategy has all tasks being completed in slightly less
 than 10 minutes per task, over the long term.

The insurance company may be interested to learn how the Basic Solution

\begin_layout Subsection
Employee Sick Time
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose that one of the employees becomes ill and cannot work.
 How would that affect the Basic Model? Does it matter which employee becomes
 ill? The answers to these questions could help management determine which
 employees to target with extra preventative health and wellness benefits
 (perhaps free flu vaccinations, or similar).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can examine this question by removing one employee at a time from the
 scheduling model, then running the Simplex Minimization algorithm again
 on the augmented model.
 This results in three new solutions (one for each ill employee) which can
 be compared to determine ill worker has the greatest impact on overall
 office productivity.
 Here we see the solutions to each augmented model.

\begin_layout Standard
While sick time for any of the employees has a clear negative impact on
 the processing time (that is, the elapsed time, 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, to process a task increases) we can spot some differences.
 The impact of sick time by Employees 1 and 3 have roughly the same affect
 on the makespan, 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, whereas when Employee 2 is ill we see that the overall impact is comparatively
 low.
 Thus, from the insurance company's point of view, if any one employee should
 get sick, it would be preferable that employee 2 becomes ill.
 Therefore, management could mitigate the risk at the least cost by offering
 only Employees 1 and 3 extra preventative health care coverage such as
 seasonal flu vaccinations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With these results on hand, management would also be able to confidently
 predict the adjusted company-wide productivity and adjust deadlines, if
 necessary, as soon as they get news that an employee has taken ill.
