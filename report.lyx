Introduction

\begin_layout Standard
The problem of 
\emph on
effectively

 allocating finite resources has been tackeled for centuries.
 Certainly, as long as there have been functional economies, even systems
 as simple as barter networks, producers have been pressured to utilize
 labour, capital, and raw materials in the most efficient manner possible.
 More generally, there exist a class of problems known as Assignment Problems.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the most general case, the Assignment Problem boils down to

.
 This could mean assigning workers of various skill levels to machines in
 a factory, scheduling specific types of products to be produced on assembly
 lines of varying capacity, reducing change-over and re-tooling costs during
 production, or many other problems.
 In this paper, we examine the problem of assigning a varied workload of
 tasks to a group of employees of varying skill levels in such a way that
 we minimize the elapsed time, commonly referred to as the

\begin_layout Standard
Our problem is important because it directly affects the throughput and,
 therefore, the profitability of the office we study.
 By finding an optimal assignment strategy that minimizes the amount of
 time it takes to complete a task, we can be sure that the office operates
 in an efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable manner over the long term.

\begin_layout Subsection
Historical Context
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While people have encountered Assignment Problems for at least several centuries
, they lacked the tools to effectively tackle them, especially in the general
 sense, until fairly recently.
 Indeed, neither the Renaissance nor the Industrial Revolution produced
 the necessary confluence of applied and theoretical mathematics and advanced
 computational technology required to enable business owners to solve these
 types of problems unassisted.

The Employee Scheduling Problem
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, we examine an insurance office that handles two types of
 work: creating new policies, and preparing claims.
 The office has three employees of varying skill levels, who each take different
 lengths of time (on average) to complete a given task.
 Here we see the average time (in minutes) required for each employee to
 complete each task type.

\begin_layout Standard
The insurance company has compiled the timings above by empirical measurement.
 We assume that the company has a healthy business and, therefore, that
 there is a steady stream of New Policy and Claim tasks that require processing
 by the office employees.
 Under these circumstances, the insurance company is interested in assigning
 some fraction of the incoming tasks to each employee so as to minimize
 the makespan, or the elapsed time required to finish all of the tasks,
 while maintaing the ratio of New Policy and Claim constant.

Modelling Approach
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To answer the question 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

how should the insurance company assign tasks to its employees to minimize
 the makespan?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, we rely on a linear programming technique known as Simplex Minimization.
 We consider 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i}$
\end_inset

, the fraction of New Policy tasks and the fraction of Claim tasks, respectively
, to be assigned to the 
\begin_inset Formula $i^{th}$
\end_inset

 employee.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our objective function is simply 
\begin_inset Formula $t$

, the elapsed time (in minutes) required to complete all of the tasks which
 needs to be minimized.

Parameters

\begin_layout Standard
The first two constraints ensure that all the tasks would be processed by
 am employee.
 These constrains ensure that we would not end up with the theoretical,
 trivial, unworthy solution 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}=q_{i}=t=0$
\end_inset

.
 In addition, any solution that does not satisfy the first two contrains
 corresponds to the case where not all of the tasks are assigned to employees
 and thus an unassigned portion of tasks would not be completed.
 The remaining other three constraints ensure that no employee exceeds the
 time requiered to complete all the tasks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The Objective Function
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Stated more precisely in mathematical terms, our objective is to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

choose values of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i}$
\end_inset

 (listed in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "table:basicvariables"

\end_inset

) that will minimize the objective function 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, subject to all trivial constraints,
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i}$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}\geq0$
\end_inset

, and all non-trivial constraints listed in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "table:basicconstraints"

\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Since we are making no assumption on the number of policies and claims
 that needs to be processes, therfore, the objective function 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 is not the same as the time in minutes requiered to complete all tasks.
 In fact, since there is a steady, health, long (infinite) sequence of policies
 and claims that needs to be processed, therefore it would take infinite
 minutes to processess all the tasks.
 On the positive side, the objective 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 corresponds to the best task assignment strategy that would minimized this
 infinite time.
 For lack of a better word, we will refer to
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 as

\begin_layout Standard
We see that the basic model is slightly more sensitive to the constraint
 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}+q_{2}+q_{3}=1$
\end_inset

, the fraction of Claim tasks assigned, since that constraint has the higher
 shadow price.
 We believe that this is caused because the average time it takes for any
 employee to handle a Claim task is higher than the average time to process
 a New Policy task.
 Thus, the insurance company may be able to streamline its operation by
 finding ways to reduce the time it takes to process a Claim task.
 Such strategies might include more employee training, process automation,
 or improvements in electronic record keeping systems

\begin_layout Subsection
Observations of the Basic Solution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our solution is only useful in the long-term where there is an infinite
 sequence of tasks to be processed.
 For example, it wouldn't make sense to assign 0.6% of a single task to one
 employee and most often, as .
 In addition to being impractical, the cost of context-switching as the
 employees handed off the partially completed task would outweigh any potential
 time savings.
 Rather, our scheduling solution would be better applied to a large list
 of tasks.
 For example, if the office had a long backlog of work (say, several hundred
 tasks) or if the insurance company is busy (and healthy), receiving a constant
 and fairly steady stream of work every day for the foreseeable future.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is interesting to note that, while no 
\emph on
individual
\emph default
 employee is able to finish any single task in less than ten minutes, our
 optimal scheduling strategy has all tasks being completed in slightly less
 than 10 minutes per task, over the long term.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Criticism
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This basic employee task appointment strategy has multiple flaws.
 Firstly, there is no information provided regarding the accuracy and methodolog
y of the measured timings listed in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "table:averagetimes"

\end_inset

.
 Additionally, a linear approximation of employees' average processing time
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "table:averagetimes"

\end_inset

) , cannot be an accurate representation of of real world worker productivity
 over a long period of time.
 For example, the authors believe that it is fairly unlikely that an employee's
 productivity would remain constraint throughout the day (let alone over
 weeks, months, or years).
 Our model does not take into account any aspect of productivity fluctuations
 caused by factors such as fatigue, boredom, enthusiasm, learning over course
 of time, etc.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additionally, The mdel does not take into account the ratio of policies
 and claims that need to be processed.
 It is very likely that the average number of policies and claims that need
 to be processed annually are not the same.
 For example, it it likly that there would be more policies that need to
 be processed and fewer claims.
 To further dig into the probable complexity of this problem, we investigate
 some variation of this problem by introducing further or different constrains.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The authors also wonder whether such a scheduling strategy could foster
 animosity and politics between the employees.
 We leave this as an open question for the reader.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Enhanced Employee Scheduling Problems
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The insurance company may be interested to learn how the Basic Solution
 reacts to other real-world conditions.
 Here, we present 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Employee Sick Time
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose that one of the employees becomes ill and cannot work.
 How would that affect the Basic Model? Does it matter which employee becomes
 ill? The answers to these questions could help management determine which
 employees to target with extra preventative health and wellness benefits
 (perhaps free flu vaccinations, or similar).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can examine this question by removing one employee at a time from the
 scheduling model, then running the Simplex Minimization algorithm again
 on the augmented model.
 This results in three new solutions (one for each ill employee) which can
 be compared to determine which ill worker has the greatest impact on overall
 office productivity.
 Here we see the solutions to each augmented model.

Solutions to the Employee Sick Time Model

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While sick time for any of the employees has a clear negative impact on
 the processing time (that is, the elapsed time, 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, to process a task increases) we can spot some differences.
 Sick time by Employees 1 and 3 has roughly the same affect on the makespan,
 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, whereas when Employee 2 is ill we see that the overall impact is comparatively
 low.
 Thus, from the insurance company's point of view, if any one employee should
 get sick, it would be preferable that employee 2 becomes ill.
 Therefore, management could mitigate the risk, at the least cost, by offering
 only Employees 1 and 3 extra preventative health care coverage such as
 seasonal flu vaccinations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These results also suggest that Employee 2 may be the least productive member
 of the team.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With these findings on hand, management would be able to confidently predict
 the adjusted company-wide productivity and adjust deadlines, if necessary,
 as soon as they get news that an employee has taken ill.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Employee Training
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Oftentimes, companies train their employees to increase efficiency and productiv
ity.
 Moreover, since professional development budgets are often limited, the
 company may wish to offer training to only a subset of its employees.
 To model a similar problem for our insurance company, we assume that the
 company has a budget for training only one of its employees with the aim
 still to reduce the total time needed to complete New Policy and Claim
 tasks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Employee Selection Criteria
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Percent increased efficiency of a given employee depends on the learning
 curve of that individual and, certainly, on the suitability of the training
 curriculum and the length of the training.
 The simplest scenario would be to assume that all the employees have the
 same linear learning curve and that the curriculum would be the same for
 all employees.
 This assumption seems reasonable since there are few quantitative metrics
 available that would measure an individuals potential suitability to a
 training program.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a result, it is reasonable to conclude that no matter which employee
 is chosen, the employee would become more efficient by the same percentage.
 Let’s assume that an employee would become 10% more efficient upon completion
 of the training.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Methodology and Outcome
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mathematically, the solution to this problem is the same as solving the
 basic model after replacing for the enhanced task completion time of the
 trained employee.
 Hence, this methodology requires solving the Basic Model 3 times, once
 per employee, and selecting the employee who yields a larger effect on
 the predicted company-wide makespan.
 Here we see the revised task completion times for each employee.
